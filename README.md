# container-queries-test

This is just a test to play around with CSS container queries.

As of July 2021, it works only on [Google Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/) and after setting the "Enable CSS Container Queries" flag. 
Do it by visiting the URL `chrome://flags/#enable-container-queries` and restart the browser.
